The visualization depicts Napolean's 1812 attempted advance towards Moscow
and inevitable retreat caused by Russia's adverse weather conditions. It is 
a replica of Charles Joseph Minard's take on the same historical event. Napolean 
attempted to attack Russia, however his troops were forced to retreat because of the onslaught 
of cold weather as depicted in this diagram. Several soldiers perished given the 
lack of food and water.
The map depicts the very same conditions during this period of time.
