Florence Nightingale was a nurse during the
Crimean War and was a strong advocate
of proper sanitation standards in hospitals
during that time. This novel visualization
of the number of deaths during April 154 to
March 1856 is famously known as Nightingale's
Cox Combs. A similar visualization is depicted 
here.
