The visualization depicts Napolean's
advance towards Moscow from France 
and their inevitable retreat 
caused by Russia's adverse 
weather conditions.It is a 
replica of Charles Joseph 
Minard's take on the same 
historical event. Napolean attempted
to attack Russia, however his troops
were forced to retreat because of 
the onslaught of cold weather 
as depicted in this diagram. 
Several soldiers perished given 
the lack of food and water. The map 
depicts the very same conditions 
during this period of time.

On being forced to retreat out 
of a burning and deserted Moscow,
the strarving French army began to
drop in numbers. By the time they
could arrive at their rendezvous 
back home, their numbers had dropped
by more than half.
